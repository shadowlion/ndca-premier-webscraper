# NDCA Entries Scraper

This is a simple web scraper that scrapes the NDCA entries from their website. It is written in Python and uses the Playwright-Python library to scrape the data. The data is then stored in a json file, which can be used to analyze the data.

## Installation

1. Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Install the Playwright browser:

```bash
python -m playwright install
```

## Usage

To use the scraper, simply run the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the prompt to execute certain commands. The data will be stored in a json file called `output/entries.json`.
